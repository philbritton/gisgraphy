 * decompounder are often based on wordlist and doesn't return unknow words (as lucene one).
 * It is not very useful when you got street names (e.g : fooStrasse).<br/><br>
 * This decompounder aim is to split a word based on words list but keep the unknow words: 
 * e.g : if words are {weg,wald} then foowegwald will return [foowegwald foo weg wald].
 * lucene one would have returned [weg wald].
