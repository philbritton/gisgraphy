<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
Hi all, my name is David Masclet, i am a software engineer and i really like GIS and all the stuff around it. (see my <a href="http://davidmasclet.free.fr/" target="_blank" >CV</a> in french). I also like agility (SCRUM,XP).
<br/><br/>
I have started Gisgraphy on November 2007, the initial goal of the project was to offer a free, open source and easy way to use Geonames data.
<br/><br/>
Step by step, I've' build the framework, first an importer with an IHM, then a geolocalisation and a fulltext webservice, a back office with statistics, ...
<br/><br/>
Then I thought that an Opensource geocoder can be useful, so i extends the framework with an importer for Openstreetmap and develop some other webservices(Street, Address parser, geocoding).
<br/><br/>
My goal was to :
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li> provide and support a lot of languages (XML, json, PHP, ruby, python, Atom, RSS / GeoRSS , more to come)</li>
    <li> A high quality software with high test coverage</li>
    <li> Easy to install, (a minimum to configure)</li>
    <li> Fully internationalized, with a lot of languages supported</li>
    <li> Provide an Opensearch module</li> 
</ul>
<br/><br/>
I hope it is the case. I am currently the only developer.
<br/><br/>
