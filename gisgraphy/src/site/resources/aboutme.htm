<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
Hi all, my name is David Masclet. I am a software engineer and I really like GIS and all the stuff around it. (see my <a href="http://davidmasclet.free.fr/" target="_blank" >CV</a> in french). I also like agility (SCRUM,XP).
<br/><br/>
I started Gisgraphy on November 2007, with the initial goal to offer a free, open source and easy way to use Geonames data.
<br/><br/>
Step by step, I've build the framework; first an importer with an IHM, then a geolocalisation, a fulltext webservice and a back office with statistics.
<br/><br/>
Then I thought that an Opensource geocoder would be useful, so I extended the framework with an importer for Openstreetmap and developed some other webservices(Street, Address parser, geocoding).
<br/><br/>
My goal was to :
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li> Provide and support a lot of languages (XML, json, PHP, ruby, python, Atom, RSS / GeoRSS , more to come)</li>
    <li> Create high quality software with good test coverage</li>
    <li> Make it easy to install, (a minimum to configure)</li>
    <li> Offer fully internationalized service, with a lot of languages supported</li>
    <li> Provide an Opensearch module</li> 
</ul>
<br/><br/>
I hope this is the case. I am currently the only developer.
<br/><br/>
