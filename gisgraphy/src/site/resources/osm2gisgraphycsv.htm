<h1>osm2gisgraphycsv</h1>
<br/>
A project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osm2gisgraphycsv/">osm2gisgraphycsv</a> has been created by willy tiengo and marcio aguiar to 
convert the Openstreetmap data from the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap site</a>openstreetmap site to the Gisgraphy CSV format.
<br/><br/>It gives the ability to add some files to the import. This program is not used by Gisgraphy to compute the files in the
 <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">download server</a> but is an external tool. It is not develop by me, and no support will be given.
