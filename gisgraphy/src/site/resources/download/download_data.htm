<h2>download server</h2>
<p>If you are interesting in downloading data you can go to :
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">Gisgraphy download server</a> if you need streets data.
 All the openstreetmap data are converted in CSV format to facilitate the import.
  There is one file per country and a file with all the countries. in addition to the native openstreetmap data, some pre-calculated fields (length, middle point) are added to the csv format.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://download.geonames.org">Geonames download server</a> if you need to download places</li>
<li>if you are intereted to download dumps (Solr/lucene dump for fulltext engine and postgres sql dump) go to the <a href="/dump.htm">dump page</a>
</ul>

<p>
A project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osm2gisgraphycsv/">osm2gisgraphycsv</a> has been created by willy tiengo and aguiar marcio to 
convert the Openstreetmap data from the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap site</a> to the Gisgraphy CSV format.
<br/><br/>It gives the ability to add some files to the import. This library is not used by Gisgraphy to compute the files in the
 <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">download server</a> but is an external tool. It is not develop by me, and no support will be given.

 <h2>Custom / premium dump</h2>
 <p> If you need some dumps with fields that are presents in Openstreetmap but not in the csv files (e.g : speed limit) or if you need more recent dump, it is possible to order <a href="http://www.gisgraphy.com/premium/index.htm#dump">custom dump</a>
