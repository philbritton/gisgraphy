<h2>Get the sources</h2>
All the sources are availables :
<ul>
<li><a href="/xref/index.html">For browsing</a></li>
<li><a href="/source-repository.html">For download</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>A little bit of technical detail...</h2>
<ul>
<li> Spring services / Hibernate mapping with a custom Hibernate dialect.</li>
<li> Lucene schema.</li>
<li> Uses PostgreSQL / PostGIS.</li>
<li> Build using Maven2.</li>
<li> Automatic synchronisation between PostgreSQL and Solr.</li>
<li> High test coverage (more than 1000 tests when this page is writen).</li>
<li> Event based design.</li>
<li> UTF-8 used throughout.</li>
<li> Gisgraphy has it's <a href="http://gisgraphy.free.fr/mavenrepo">own Maven repository</a> with all the dependencies.</li>
<li> Designed with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/internal-dsls-java">DSL</a> (Domain Specific Language).</li>
<li> Designed with the <a href="http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/">DDD</a> paradigm.</li>
<li> Test to avoid memory leak</li>
<li> <a href="/bench.htm">Benchs</a> are run for each release to see if performances are good</li>
</ul>

<h2>Build</h2>
Gisgraphy is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a>, you simply need to be familiar with it. To ease the build, a <a href="http://gisgraphy.free.fr/mavenrepo" target="gisgraphy">dedicated Maven repository</a> is available.
You have to <a href="">Install</a> Postgres, postGis, and setup a Gisgraphy database as you could do for a common gisgraphy installation. Then run 
<div class="code">
<pre>
	mvn clean test
</pre>
</div>

To compile an run the tests.

<h2>IDE / Eclipse</h2>
Personnaly, I use eclipse to develop but you can use NetBeans or any other IDE.
To set up Gisgraphy in Eclipse :
<ul>
<li>Go to File-> New-> Project from SVN</li>
<li>Then create a new location repository with the source repository link you can find on the <a href="/source-repository.html">Chekout page</a></li>
<li>Once it is checkout, Open a command line and run a "mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse"</li>
<li>Go back to Eclipse and refresh the project into your workspace (right click->Refresh).</li>
</ul>
